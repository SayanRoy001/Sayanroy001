## About me
- Final-year IT undergraduate (IIEST Shibpur).  
- Interned as an **Advanced Application Engineering Analyst** at Accenture (Hyderabad).  
- Comfortable with Python + frontend stacks; actively learning backend APIs, deployment, and production-ready ML pipelines.  
- Strong interest in **problem solving (DSA) and competitive programming** — I practice to improve algorithmic thinking, complexity analysis, and robust implementations.

## 🧠 Problem-Solving & Competitive Programming

I write effective and accurate solutions by practicing **DSA and competitive programming** to strengthen my problem-solving abilities. **C++** is my primary programming language.

- **Platforms:** LeetCode, CodeChef, Codeforces
- **Focus areas:** Arrays, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Binary Search, Number Theory  
- **Approach:** Analyze constraints → select optimal data structures → write clear, edge-case-safe code  

Solved counts and ratings are available in my coding profiles and resume.
