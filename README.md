## About me
- Final-year IT undergraduate (IIEST Shibpur).  
- Interned as an **Advanced Application Engineering Analyst** at Accenture (Hyderabad).  
- Comfortable with Python + frontend stacks; actively learning backend APIs, deployment, and production-ready ML pipelines.  
- Strong interest in **problem solving (DSA) and competitive programming** — I practice to improve algorithmic thinking, complexity analysis, and robust implementations.

## 🧠 Competitive Programming & Problem Solving
I enjoy DSA and competitive programming because they improve the way I approach complex problems and write correct, efficient code.

- **Practice areas:** Graphs, Trees, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Number Theory, Data Structures.  
- **Approach I follow:** Understand constraints → choose right data structure → prove complexity bounds → write clean code handling corner cases.  
- Current practice log and solved counts are in my profile and resume. See resume for achievements. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
